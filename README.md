# Market-Data-Feed-Handler

Time Estimate: Approximately 60-90 hours
Description: Develop a market data feed handler that processes real-time market data from a public API or a sample data file.
Develop a market data feed handler that processes real-time market data from a public API or a sample data file. This project involves connecting to a market data source, processing incoming data, and performing data analysis or order book updates. It requires knowledge of market data formats, network protocols, and data processing techniques.
This project involves understanding market data formats, handling data streams efficiently, and providing real-time updates to trading systems.
It also involves designing and implementing a robust and efficient data feed handler capable of receiving and processing streaming market data updates.
Clearly document your design choices, system architecture, and important implementation details. 
Discuss the challenges faced, the strategies employed to overcome them, and the reasoning behind your design decisions.
Getting Started: Study the structure and format of market data feeds. 
Research available market data APIs or obtain a sample data file for testing purposes.
Establish a connection to the market data source and subscribe to real-time data updates.
Implement data parsing and processing logic to extract relevant information or update order books.
Design a data feed handler that can efficiently receive and process streaming market data updates.
Implement the necessary protocols and data structures to handle the data feed.

Problem-solving: Address challenges related to handling real-time data updates, data synchronization, and efficient data storage.
Optimization: Optimize the data feed processing for speed and efficiency. 
Consider techniques such as data compression, parallel processing, or low-latency networking. 
Measure and document the performance improvements achieved.
Documentation: Create a README file that provides an overview of the market data feed handler, explains the design choices, and describes the implementation details.
Document the data feed handler's functionality, supported data formats, and integration instructions.
Consider providing sample code or scripts that demonstrate the usage of the market data feed handler.
Include code comments that provide clarity and context. 
Consider writing technical documentation or blog posts to explain the market data feed handling concepts, your work, and any interesting findings.
